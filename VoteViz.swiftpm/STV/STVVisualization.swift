                        Single Transferrable Vote is an electoral system where voters rank all candidates. If a voter's preferred candidate cannot win, the vote goes to the second priority on the ballot, and so forth. Ensuring that the vote is not wasted. This allows voters to vote for the candidate they agree with the most and hence eliminates the need for tactical voting.

                        The system works through a series of rounds where candidates are either elected or eliminated. Change the parameters and candidates below and see how that effects the results in the table on the right.
